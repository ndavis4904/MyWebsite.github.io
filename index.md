## About Me

My name is Nicholas Davis. I am currently in a Masters of Science program through ASU's online degree program for program evaluation and data analytics. Before this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology with a minor in Statistics. I cuurently work as a manager at the Burley Taco Bell, but I am actively looking to start my career that corresponds with my degrees.
